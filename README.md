# BAFPointsBot 
This bot was created to manage a roblox group on a discord server by adding/removing points and by promoting/demoting players by saving all data on a database.  
I started working on this bot a few years ago but I didn't have any coding experience (in fact I'm not satisfied with my code) but I intend to work on it in my free time. 

# HOW TO USE 
Personally, I'm using this bot on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> where I can host it for free; also, I'm using the JawsDB Maria add-on to create the database, but you're free to host it wherever you want (even on your own device, but be sure to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> first and the relative packages listed on the <a href="https://github.com/alessand86014/BAFPointsBot/blob/main/package.json">package.json</a> file; you can then start the bot with <code>node main.js</code>). There are some env variables to specify; to do this you might want to create a .env file (I uploaded a .env.example file, just fill it out and remove the .example part). 

# CREDITS 
I took the foundation of this bot from <a href="https://github.com/LengoLabs/qbot">LengoLabs's qbot repository</a>.
